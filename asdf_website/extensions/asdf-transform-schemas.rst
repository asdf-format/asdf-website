ASDF Transform Schemas
======================

The :ref:`ASDF Transform Schemas <asdf-transform-schemas:asdf-transform-schemas>` define a set of schemas for serializing the models defined by :ref:`astropy.modeling <astropy:astropy-modeling>` for the ASDF file format. These schemas are based upon the schemas in the :ref:`ASDF Standard <asdf-standard:asdf-standard>` and are packaged for use by the :ref:`ASDF <asdf:asdf>` library.

.. admonition:: Note
    :class: note
    
    This is only a schema package; you need to install the :ref:`asdf-astropy <asdf-astropy:asdf-astropy>` package in order to use these schemas to serialize astropy models.

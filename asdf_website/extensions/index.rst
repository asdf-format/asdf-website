Transforms
----------

:doc:`ASDF Transform Schemas <asdf-transform-schemas>`


The ASDF Transform Schemas define a set of schemas for serializing the models defined by :ref:`astropy.modeling <astropy:astropy-modeling>` for the ASDF file format. These schemas are based upon the schemas in the :ref:`ASDF Standard <asdf-standard:asdf-standard>` and are packaged for use by the :ref:`ASDF <asdf:asdf>` library.

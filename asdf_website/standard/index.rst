ASDF Standard
=============

The :ref:`ASDF Standard <asdf-standard:asdf-standard>` prescribes the specification and implementation standards for creating, editing and reading files that use the Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF). This is a good place to start if you want to understand more about the file layout, tree structure, and core schema requirements of ASDF.

If you are interested in developing a custom extension or implementing ASDF in another language, be sure to review the ASDF Standard documentation above, as you'll need to understand the schemas. If you're planning to build your own extension based on one of the existing :doc:`optional extensions <../extensions/index>`, you'll also want to review the docs for that particular schema as well.

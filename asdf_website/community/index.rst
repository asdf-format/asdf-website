Discussions & Community Calls

The ASDF development team also extends an invitation for you to join our monthly ASDF Office Hours via webex. These are open to everyone and will be held every first Friday of the month. The session will start with a short (~10 min) presentation on a topic related to ASDF and will be open for questions and discussions. The goal is to provide an opportunity to directly interact with the development team, answer questions about ASDF, Roman and JWST use of ASDF, as well as get feedback from the community (that's you!).

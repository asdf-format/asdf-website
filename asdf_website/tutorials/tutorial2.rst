Using ASDF with Astronomical Data
=================================

Intro
-----

This tutorial covers some of the content in `tutorial1` but is more heavily geared toward astronomers. More advanced analytical tools such as numpy and matplotlib are used to read and manipulate a combined resampled product of two JWST NIRCam observations inside an ASDF file.

For a full walkthrough using Jupyter Notebook, head over to the workshop on Github: `ADASS 2024 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf-adass2024>`__
